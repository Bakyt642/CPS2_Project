• Abstract:

This report sets out a proposed system for monitoring the work progress around a workbench located in the factory ITM. It represents the objective of the project and the expected results, with illustrating the requirements in terms of technologies and hardwares needed for implementing and design such a system.





• Objectives and expected results:

The objective of this project is to monitor the environment around a workbench and to supervise the work progress. The workbench is occupied by many sensors that measure and produce data. The data could be the workspace temperature, humidity and light. Some sensors are targeted to identify the worker ID, and to count the products produced during the work session.
All this data should be shown on an interactive screen with the ability to retrieve the old data from a database hosted on a cloud based on some parameters such as the work data, the worker name or his identifier.
The web application is hosted on a cloud, therefore the data retrieving can be achieved using any device connected to the internet and has the required permissions to access.

To sum up, the system assists the supervisor to figure out the environment status during the work session, to count the hours worked by workers and to observe the production process.
